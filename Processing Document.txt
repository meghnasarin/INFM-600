Original Dataset: Pew Research. (2012). February 2012 – Search, Social Networks, and Politics. Retrieved from http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets/february-2012-search-social-networks-and-politics/


New Dataset: Meghna Sardana Sarin. (2015). Social Media and Politics. Unpublished Raw Data. Available From https://github.com/meghnasarin/INFM-600.git


The original focal data set was processed by taking a subset of it that resulted in a new dataset which focuses solely on people's internet usage and their social media behaviour related to politics. The processing was carried out in the following steps:

a) Firstly, data related to books and e-books was deleted. This was done by deleting the variables q2,q3a,q3b,q3c from the original dataset.

b) Then, data related to internet use for Wikipedia and online search was deleted. This was achieved by deleting the variables activ52, activ103 from the    original dataset.

c) Then, data related to gadgets owned by responders was removed. This data was unnecessary for the research questions and therefore the variables q10a till q15c were    removed from the dataset.

d) Lastly, data related to online search engines and search behaviour of respondents was removed. To achieve this, the variables from q32 till q42c were removed.

e) The resulting subset of data is the new dataset "Social Media and Politics" that has data relevant to my analysis. In the excel dataset file Sheet 1 is the modified dataset itself and Sheet 2 contains the removed columns/variables from the original dataset (for tracking purposes only)
