DATASET SOURCE
The focal data set used for this assignment is not from data.howardcountymd.gov or opendata.howardcountymd.gov. There were no relevant data sets available for "Social Media". I found the data set from http://wiki.urbanhogfarm.com/index.php/Category:Dataset.

ORIGINAL FOCAL DATASET
Pew Research. (2012). February 2012 – Search, Social Networks, and Politics. Retrieved from http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets/february-2012-search-social-networks-and-politics/


DESCRIPTION
The data set mentioned above is a tracking survey that was conducted in February 2012 and contains data on search engine usage, social media and political interactions on social networking sites. The survey was conducted using phone (both telephone and cellphone).The survey starts off with determining people's internet usage, followed by the gadgets they own, search engines and social networking sites being used by them,  political discussions on social media and social media behaviour related to political issues and lastly their demographics.

ORGANIZING THE DATASET
I haven't found out any data set that could be combined with the focal data set mentioned above. I consulted the following sources: WikiData, www.data.gov, http://databib.org, http://aws.amazon.com/datasets and many more. There is a lot of data http://www.census.gov/ (US Census), however it cannot be used to extend the focal data set that I already have.
I have decided to subset the focal data set to limit the number of variables involved and narrow down the scope of the data set only to Social Media usage with respect to Political issues.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The following Research questions can be answered using this dataset:

	a ) Are Men more likely to discuss (share and post) political issues on social networking sites as opposed to women?
	
	Motivation: It is a generally held notion that men are more involved in discussing political issues in general. It would be interesting to note if this notion 		holds true or not specifically to social media.

	Analysis: TO analyse this research question, we can have Sex as an independent variable and q20,q21 as dependent variables. 

	Representing the Results: The best way to represent these results would be in a tabular format where the the dependent variables and their values are listed  		across the independent variable, Sex. This way it would be easier to visualize the results simultaneously for both men and women and do a comparative analysis.


	b) Is there an Age gap in how social networks affect one's political views overall among young adults (18-40 years) and older adults (40+)?

	Motivation: It is a common observation that young people use social media on a larger scale as opposed to older adults. Therefore, it would be interesting to 		analyse whether this also affects their political views.

	Analysis: To analyse this research question, we can categorize Age which is the independent variable into two groups : 18-40 and 40+. The dependent variable in 	this case can be scale created out of variables q31a, q31b and q31c.

	Representing the Results: The best way to represent these results would be to create a scatter plot in different colours for the two age groups. This would 		help in visualizing any differences that might be exist in the dependent variable owing to age. The scatter plot can also be accompanied by a frequency table 		to clearly state the numbers involved in this analysis.
